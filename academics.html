	 <h3>The 2022-23 school year was the most difficult one yet. Although I excelled in my passion classes (AP CSP, Modern World History), I struggled to keep up with the pressure of Spanish. Since I had not had Spanish the previous year, the basics I learned 2 years prior were fading from my memory. Health Science was introduced this year along an unusual new curriculum, which left me with many questions. I'm positive that everyone who took the semester-long class got weirded out/disguisted many times. As the homework continued to pile up throughout the year, what kept me going was the motivation to avoid a repeat of my terrible habits over the remote learning years, which barely gave me passing grades in middle school.</h3>
